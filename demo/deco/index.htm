       <p>Whilst on holiday, I was reluctantly dragged into a 'shell shop'.  My mind  recalled terrible sea-side trinkets, overpriced  and tasteless nasties from British coastal resorts.</p>
       
       <p>Very quickly though, I realised that shells are actualy incredibly beautiful. I initially assumed this change of heart was a result of advancing age and maturity -only last year I realised how beautiful flowers are, which I completely blamed on turning 40.</p>
