       <p>It's easy to take things for granted.  But when you start looking closer at natural structures using designer eyes, their complexity, intricacy and beauty can suddenly become
       overwhelming.</p>
       
       <p>Imagine being given a brief to create a portable shelter for a soft bodied organism to protect it from life in the ocean, to include protection from predators.  I could never have begun to imagine the designs that evolution/divinity (delete as you see fit) has come up with.</p>
        
       <p> Just look at them ! They are staggeringly complex, beautiful and hugely varied. Breathtaking.</p>
