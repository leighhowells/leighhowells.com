        <h1>What is AWID?</h1>

<blockquote>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>To be a driving force within the global community of feminist and women’s rights activists, organizations and movements, strengthening our collective voice, impact and influence to transform structures of power and decision-making and advance human rights, gender justice and environmental sustainability.</p>

 </blockquote>



<h3>Our values: the principles that guide our work</h3>

<p>Our work is built upon feminist values toward the full realization of women’s rights and human rights of all people. This includes work towards the eradication of all discriminations based on gender, sexuality, religion, age, ability, ethnicity, language, nationality, class or other factors. We are committed to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work as part of a movement to build our collective voice, power and influence</li>
<li>Diversity and inclusion, ensuring that in our work we are opening spaces and convening different expressions of women’s organizing—particularly from groups that have not been as visible or included in more traditional women’s rights work and instances in the past</li>
<li>Transparency, responsible use of financial resources, fairness, accountability and integrity in all our interactions</li>
<li>Work independently from any political party, government or religious institution</li>
<li>Strive for excellence, while being creative, bold and courageous</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our outcomes: what we hope to achieve</h3>

<p>In working with diverse partners and allies and our broader constituency AWID seeks to achieve the following five outcomes by the end of our Strategic Plan.</p>

<ol class="boxes-list">

<li>Women’s rights organizations and movements are well informed and equipped to effectively respond to opportunities and counter threats to women’s human rights at different levels. </li>

<li>Shifts made in policies and practices of diverse influential actors and institutions that shape or influence human rights and development outcomes (including donors, development agencies, business sector, human rights institutions and major CSOs) to advance, respect, protect and fulfill women’s rights and promote gender justice.</li>

<li>Expanded solidarity and powerful joint action among women’s rights activists and allies through meaningful inclusion and engagement of historically excluded or discriminated groups of women.</li>

<li>Women’s rights activists across generations, causes and movements are accessing and using knowledge and other resources to strengthen their security and wellness, and expand the enjoyment of their own human rights.</li>

<li>Greater visibility and understanding of women’s rights initiatives, the threats they face and effective response strategies led by women and women’s rights organizations, among influential actors and institutions that shape human rights and development outcomes.</li>

</ol>
<br/>
<p>In order to achieve our mission and outcomes, AWID works through multi-year initiatives.</p>
