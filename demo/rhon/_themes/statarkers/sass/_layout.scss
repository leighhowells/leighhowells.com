// LAYOUT RULES
// =====================================

// CSS, by its very nature, is used to lay elements out on the page.
// However, there is a distinction between layouts dictating the major and minor components of a page.
// The minor components such as a callout, or login form, or a navigation item sit within the scope of major components such as a header or footer.
