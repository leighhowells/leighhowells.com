<p class="intro">Red, White and Blue Day is a chance for every school in the country to show their support for the huge number of service families in the UK.</p>


<p>Red, White and Blue DayRed, White and Blue Day is run jointly by the RAF Benevolent Fund and our partner charities ABF The Soldiers' Charity, and the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity.</p>

<p>Red, White and Blue Day is a national campaign focusing on Service children and aims to help their school friends understand the complications and pressures they undergo when separated from one or more of their parents for long periods at a time.</p>

<p>This year Red, White and Blue Day takes place on October 10, though schools can can choose any day in October or November to hold their own Red, White and Blue Day.</p>

<p>We want lots of schools taking part so if you&rsquo;re a teacher why not encourage your school to sign up? Visit the Red, White and Blue Day to register your school and to download a welcome pack.</p>
