Remembrance Day is always a poignant day for me, as I remember both family and friends who have served and sacrificed for their country.

My father was in the RAF, based at RAF Bruggen, and unfortunately passed away in 1986 when I was just two years old, leaving behind my mum, my big sister and me.

The RAF Benevolent Fund stepped in to help fund mine and my sister's education. Without the RAF Benevolent Fund's help, I wouldn't have left school with such a good education and good exam results.

They're the reason I joined the RAF and I'm currently a successful and well respected serviceman with two small children of my own.
