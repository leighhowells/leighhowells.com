###What is Pulmonary embolism?

If the pressure in the blood vessels in your lungs (the pulmonary circulation) is unusually high, this is called pulmonary hypertension. The pulmonary circulation takes blood that is low in oxygen through the pulmonary arteries from the right side of your heart to your lungs.

This is where the red blood cells pick up oxygen. The blood, which now contains lots of oxygen, is then pumped back to the left side of your heart, which pumps it to the rest of your body (see diagram below).
