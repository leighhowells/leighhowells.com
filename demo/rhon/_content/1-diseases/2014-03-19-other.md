###Other rarer lung diseases

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein mainly produced by your liver that is released into in your blood. There are other proteins called enzymes that are found in all parts of your body that help to make sure that chemical reactions in your body take place normally. Enzymes have many important roles in your lung, including removing bacteria and fighting infections. The AAT protein is needed to control enzyme activity to prevent healthy lung tissue being damaged.
