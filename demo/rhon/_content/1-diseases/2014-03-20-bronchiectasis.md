###What is bronchiectasis?

If you have bronchiectasis, your airways become widened and cannot clear themselves properly. This means mucus builds up and the tubes can become infected by bacteria. If bacteria survive in the tubes, they become inflamed, which can further damage your airways. Once the damage has occurred, it is permanent.

The exact number of people who have bronchiectasis is unknown, but some studies suggest there are at least 30,000 people in the UK with the condition.
