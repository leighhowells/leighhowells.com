###What is Ideopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis?

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and ultimately fatal disease characterized by a progressive decline in lung function.

The term pulmonary fibrosis means scarring of lung tissue and is the cause of worsening dyspnea (shortness of breath). Fibrosis is usually associated with a poor prognosis.  The term 'idiopathic' is used because the cause of pulmonary fibrosis is still unknown.
