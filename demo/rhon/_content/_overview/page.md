###Overview of this research project.

Your body is made up of many different types of cells, and tightly controls the production of new cells when they are needed.
Cancer develops when certain cells escape from your body’s control and start to change. These abnormal cells, also called cancer cells, then start to increase and grow to form a lump. This is called a tumour.

Tumours can be benign or malignant:

Malignant tumours are what we know as ‘cancer’ – they might grow quickly and can spread around the body to other organs.
Benign tumours usually grow very slowly, if at all, and do not spread. However, they can make people ill by pressing on important parts of the body
Most lung cancers develop in the airways that carry air in and out of your lungs, but they can also start in the lung tissue itself.

If the cancer starts in your lung, it is called primary lung cancer. If it has started in another part of your body and spread to affect your lung, it is called secondary lung cancer.
