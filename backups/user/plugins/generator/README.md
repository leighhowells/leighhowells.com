# Grav SSG plugin

This plugin is built to fit into [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) which is a flat-file CMS.

It allows to build a static version of all pages generated by the CMS, in order to serve this version without any server-side processing.

That version is thus quite protected from security hacks such as SQL or XSS injections.

### Implementation

Typically, let's say you are building your website under the domain name mysite.com .

- You can create a subfolder /grav and install in there a Grav based website, theme it,... and protect it with a basic .htaccess to make sure you're the only one accessing it.
- Install the plugin, rename the plugin folder "generator", set the options as destination_folder=../ and destination_domain=http://mysite.com .
- Generate the export from http://mysite.com/grav/admin/generator
- Your website is publicly accessible from http://mysite.com
