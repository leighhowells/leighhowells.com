I started designing on a Sinclair Spectrum as a kid in the early 80′s, using packages which didn’t even allow me to save what I’d created.  They had 8 colours.  I learnt to dither to simulate more.  I created fonts on an 8X8 grid.  It beeped.  I bought a multichannel sound board. Then it beeped in 4 channels.

I programmed graphics and games and wrote music on 8-bit machines. I worked my way up to the Atari 800 XL - which gave a whole rainbow of colours (256 in fact) to choose from.  It also had multichannel sound. I wrote music by programming Basic, created sound envelopes with for/next loops. For a while its capabilities overwhelmed me.

I got over it and bought an Atari ST in 1989. This had 4,096 colours and built in MIDI sockets. It had the GEM operating system – one of the first GUIs. I got a DTP package. I got a word processor.  I got an art package. I could save things to floppy disk ! I got a MIDI sequencer.  Heck, I even got a dot matrix printer. I produced lavish black and white dotty graphics at University.  I produced MIDI music.

Throughout academic and early work, I always became the presentation guy.  Whatever means were available from crayons, sugar paper and Spraymount to Vax VMS and laser printer output.

Then one day I heard of this thing called the Internet.
