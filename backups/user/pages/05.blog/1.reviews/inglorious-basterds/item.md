It's taken me far too long to get around to seeing this film, despite being quite a Tarantino fan.  

There are some incredibly well written and tense scenes with brilliant timing and editing that you know will stay with you for a long time. It's all served up with the usual cartoon pop-culture graphics and soundtrack that give Taratino films their distinctive style.

Christopher Waltz was absolutely amazing, stealing the film completely for me - another unpredictable, intelligent, eloquent and terrifying Tarantino 
villain. 

Not quite as gory as some other Tarantino films, it still made me wince quite a few times - especially the finger in the bullet hole scene.  Oh yes, that'll be one of those scenes that will be staying with me for a long time.
