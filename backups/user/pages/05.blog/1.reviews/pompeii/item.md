This is basically Gladiator with an imminently rumbly, erupting volcano.  So much seemed to be lifted straight from Ridley Scott's epic that it became a bit laughable.  It only got more farcical during the ending action sequences, despite some very impressive vulcan visuals.  The film's only saving grace is that the ending didn't try and defy the reality of the situation, which would have been completely ludicrous.  [5/10]
