I can't deny it, I'm quite partial to breakout films.  This one features both Stallone and Schwarzenegger looking pretty good considering they're both pushing 70.  They must really love making films, I'm very sure they don't need to work.

The breakouts were ok, but it got a bit tiring.  I think there was also a bit of sub plot intrigue going on, but I was a bit too bored to be bothered following.  Some shockingly poor CGI and corny one-liners, but a nice floating prison concept. [5/10]
