A well crafted little film following the story of a team of reporters looking into a newspaper advert for a time traveller's assistant.  

The heart of the film lays in the fact that we never really know if the placer of the advert is a genius or a lunatic. Some nice little touches along the way that keep you guessing, and it's all kept fairly ambiguous.

The ending leaves no trace of ambiguity, however, which is a bit of a shame as it could have been a little more subtle. Enjoyable none-the-less. [6/10]
