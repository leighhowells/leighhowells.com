Quite enjoyed this retelling of Sleeping Beauty.  Some impressive visuals, striking performance from Angelina Jolie and some very cute creature creations.  

True love's kiss seems to be a little concept that gets rolled out time and time again - popping up with neat little twists in both Frozen and Malificent in recent months.  I'm pretty sure Disney need to think up some new ideas to end a fairytale as they surely can't use this idea again for a while, can they?  However, I suppose Sleeping beauty and tales based on it will always have full rights for the ending baked right in.

Enjoyable, to be remembered mostly for some ludicrously sharp cheek bones and some very flappy wings.  [7/10]
