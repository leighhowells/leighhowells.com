After reading both this and 'The Girl Who Saved the King of Sweden', I kind of felt both stories suffered from the same problem.  They both started off well, and were amusing, but they seemed to go on a bit and got tiring.  I think this might just be me, however.  I didn't feel the same about this film adaptation at all.  

Avoiding the fact that the 100 yr old version of Robert Gustafsson only looked about 70, this was a brilliant adaptation of the book.  Smart, funny with impecable comic timing.  The music of Matti Bye adds a lot of character to the overall feel of the film with a very clever US-Russian-circus main theme.

Some may draw comparisons with Forest Gump, which is fair enough.  But that contained a lot of fun ideas too. [8/10]
