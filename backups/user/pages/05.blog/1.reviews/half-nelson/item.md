Ryan Gosling plays a disfunctional history teacher in Brooklyn.  He's not a very good teacher because he's got a bit of a drug issue.  Beneath his disheveleed exterior, however, he genuinely cares about some of his pupils.  Especially if they happen to catch him smoking crack in the toilets.

I'm not sure this film had much point. It challenged a couple of sterotypes here and there, but I'm not sure anything really got resolved by the end of 106 minutes.  Most of all it left me feeling a bit claustrophobic as there were hardly any shots other than close-ups with lots of bonus wobbly camera action.  I longed for a solid sweeping establishing shot, but it never seemed to come. Was quite glad when it ended, despite haveing some interesting moments. [5/10]
