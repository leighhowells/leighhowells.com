I loved The Killing, and I'm sad it's now finished for good (most probably).

Here's a brief summary:

Season 1 - Excellent   
Season 2 - What? Really? Still?   
Season 3 - Excellent, relief after Season 2   
Season 4 - Very good, but very short   

A dark, brooding series - from Danish 'detective noir' remade in Vancouver, Canada which seems to be as equally bleak and cold as anywhere in Scandinavia.  I loved The Killing and it became an obsessive binge watch.
 The main coupling of Linden and Holder was unexpected, but worked well and the stories gritty, grimey and compulsive viewing.  
 
 It's a shame that certain things came to pass in the last season that went against a lot of what came before. [8/10]
