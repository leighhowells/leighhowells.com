I'm still very thankful to coding the design for&nbsp;my current project instead of using a graphics editing package.&nbsp;Once you have everything set up, the pain involved in modifying and creating new templates is reduced massively.

Initially it can be a bit painful if there's a tight deadline - as it can feel like you aren't getting anywhere very&nbsp;slowly.   

But with rapid inertia&nbsp;the subsequent stages become so much easier and more&nbsp;satisfying.
