<p class="max-width">At some point I decided it might be fun for me and my son to drive a couple of thousand km around Scandinavia.</p>

<p class="max-width">The plan was to stay in random accommodation types and generally drive from Copenhagan to Stockholm, up and across to Oslo and south again back to Copenhagan down the Swedish west coast, taking in a few places I visited in my youth.</p>
