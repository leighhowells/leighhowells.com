A little bit of nostalgia.  Headscape members formerly known as Avatar Interactive put together this little Christmas game during December of 2000. 

===



I've cunningly slapped a new Headscape logo on it and sent it back out into the world again as though it's new. Minutes of fun for all the family. Well, If nothing else it at least has a jingly festive tune.

Excellent Actionscript 1 from Chris Sanderson (definitely more cunning code than 'do everything' Actionscript 3 - which is for wimps).  Sound 'design' and music by me.  'You're fired' voice brought to you by Paul Boag (he was good at saying that).  'doh' sound effect brought to you by Pete Boston. Lovely festive Illustration by Becky Gray.
