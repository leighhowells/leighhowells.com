I've been experimenting this week with wire-framing IA and exploring content etc from a single column mobile width first.  I've never worked this way before, and it's turning out to be pretty interesting.

There is a bit of an issue starting to develop, however.  Basically I've not really given much thought to desktop yet, the complete opposite of the normal problem.  Normally I figure I've got a fairly good idea of what's happening at mobile, but often it turns out that actually I don't.   Well, working this way round is making me forget a bit about desktop, in fact I don't seem to care about desktop.  It's outdated surely?

What on Earth shall I fill it all up with with now I've got everything working nicely on a tiny screen?

Can someone please develop a narrow web browser for desktop, then we don't have to worry about ALL THAT SPACE...
