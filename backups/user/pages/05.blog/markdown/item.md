I'm still streamlining what is being passed from my markdown files to the main templates.  Finally managed to pass the background image to the body tag, although there is now an inline style in the final page.  But it's only a single file, so I have forgiven myself completely.   I've also managed to sort out a footer, although I believe it's living in an <aside> as it wasn't the footer to begin with.   Should probably change that.
