title: What am I thankful for
---

I'm thankful to wake up in a comfortable bed.  I know that the cost of a comfortable bed is as little as about 100quid for a memory foam mattress and a 190 X 90 cm space in which to put it.  I'm thankful that I have that space, and that the space is warm (when it needs to be) and dry.  I'm thankful for that space being safe.

I'm thankful that I live in a country which is relatively safe from natural disaster areas, from killer creatures, from killer weather systems, from war, from persistent terror (mostly), from massively corrupt leadership.   I'm thankful I escape 'the draft' that faced my forebears - to be slaughtered in a foreign country against my will.

I'm thankful that I was born with genetics that have allowed me to reach the age of nearly 50 with very very few problems.  I've had the energy and the ability to do and to see so many things.

I'm thankful from my genentic have come intelligence, or at least the greed to be curious and to observe and question, then to experiment and to discover.

I'm thankful that I have humour, can see the light and the shade and mostly choose the right way forward.

I'm thankful that I had children, and children without huge disability which would have broken me.

I'm thankful I've been able to work and provide for my children to adulthood (and near adulthood).  They have had what they needed and both got through 'school' days.

I'm thankful I met friends in my 6th formy days that changed me to love to travel and to need little to do so.  Those trips around Europe shaped me more than I could possibly have known.

I'm thankful I understand that I need to live a life that is true to myself and not the life that is expected of me.

I'm thankful that I've done a job that has used my skills to their foremost which has blended all the things I love, creativity with programming, with logic and a little bit of geography, even music.  It's been amazing.  I can't expect that this will always be possible but it's been great and I'm so thankful for it.

I'm thankful that I love to walk and to explore and record what I see.  This only requires an input of energy.
