Susy is a grid system for SAS. It looks like it has the power of a framework grid without all the pointless crap that will never get used.

Some of my fellow webonaughts believe that building your own grid system is the best way, I don't really have the confidence in the infallibility of my coding skills to deal with responsive grid layout switches, so Susy looks like a pretty great option for me.
