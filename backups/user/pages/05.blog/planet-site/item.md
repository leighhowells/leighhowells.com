 I redesigned my site over the course over the weekend.  It was boring and I hated it.

It has no 'Posts by Month'? ** No, but there is a 'rocket ship'. **

There's no detailed categorisation? ** No, but there is a 'papery planet'**

There's no 'Latest Comments'? ** No, but there are aliens.  Wearing pants.**

Ugh, it's sideways scrolling??  Surely that's just stupid?  ** Possibly.  But I like it.**

With hand crafted illustrative bits, a retro paper cutout feel, sideways scrolling, a lack of 'latest xxxx' widgets, tag clouds etc,  I've made a site that is really quick and easy to update and is much more accessible via iOS too using lots of media queries.   But mostly, it's just a bit of fun and that's a good thing, right?

Incidentally, below is the inspiration for this site; my **first ever** piece of school work.Â  You can see how far I haven't come.

Full credit to Mr John Hicks, who's template 'Shelf' available on [Theme Foundry](http://thethemefoundry.com/) saved me forever in code/css twiddling and gave me inspiration for a sideways scroller.
