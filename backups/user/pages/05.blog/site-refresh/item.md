So I decided to refresh my site a little over the weekend as I was bored of being stranded on an alien planet.  It's still silly of course.  I refuse to have a dull corporate site, after all a personal site should have a bit of 'personality' right?

Instead I'm now where I'd most like to be in the whole world.  Anywhere with a lovely coral reef.  Somewhere sunny.  Although, actually I don't think I'd want quite this many sharks circling in the background.  They are probably symbolic/metaphorical sharks though :)

I also took a bit of time to fix some responsive issues I'd noticed, although I really wish I'd used the Sass/Susy grid system when I built this earlier in the year.

I do love being able to completely refresh this site by changing 6 images and a few Sass variables. Although now I'm wondering if it's all got a bit garish.  I should probably tone down the orange a tad.  Maybe.
