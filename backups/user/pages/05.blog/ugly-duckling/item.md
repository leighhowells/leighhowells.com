I'm not a big fan of swans.  Graceful yes.  Slightly scary and generally annoying, definitely.  In fact they used to be my mortal enemy when I used to be a keen fisherman.  

But as I came across this mother and her lone cygnet, even I had to admit that it was a rather cute scene; especially as the baby had a feather stuck on it's beak.

Wake up!  I'm coming at you with a boat. And a camera!

I intend to follow the development of this little baby swan as it grows, presuming no clumsy oaf trying to take photos in a boat accidentally kills it.

Yes.  You look a bit silly with that stuck on your beak.

In fact, they are all at it down on the river at the moment.
