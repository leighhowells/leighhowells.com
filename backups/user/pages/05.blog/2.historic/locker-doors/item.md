When I was in the 6th form, which I guess would be year 12/13 nowadays we had small wooden lockers.  I think we were the last year to have these before a new 6th form building was built, so we were allowed to paint the doors as we wanted.

Looking back I guess this was a good chance to show off some of my creative skills for all to see, but of course they aren't as good as I remember.   The door above became my future wife's locker once I had left for University, and the year after that the locker was passed onto her sister.  I had to paint new names on as appropriate.

This was my other locker door, which even had gold paint in the design at the top right.  Nice.

There was another locker that I don't have a picture of, which I painted for another girl in the lower sixth,  I know it featured a large mushroom with something sitting beneath it.  I guess I had too much time on my hands back then.
