We have spent the last couple of days enjoying the novelty of being next to a beautiful swimming pool basking beneath blue skies and endless sunshine.  Of course this means that removal of clothing is obligatory, yet it seems that some are removing more clothing than others.

The Spanish women in particular are enjoying tanning their breasts.  Unfortunately in my opinion 98% should keep them hidden under the safety of a bikini top. I don't think the spanish women here can be truly representative of Spanish womanhood generally, however, as one or two of the younger women on the beach give a glimpse into a very different state of affairs.
  
There are a wide variety of breasts on display ranging from tiny fried eggs to outrageously large and drooping melons. (funny how many breast similes are food based isn't it) . Ok, I know I am not the finest specimen of male physique but at least I do not parade my inadequacies endlessly for all to see.

In true fairness the women round the pool are probably far more concerned with family or career than maintaining their bodies.  I understand that once a woman has had children things change, nature tugs at the extremities and time and gravity claim the perkiness they may have once had. All the exercise and dieting in the world will never bring back their youthful bodies.

All I am really saying here is that sometimes the mystery of the hidden flesh is far more appealing than the reality.  Imagination can be a powerful aphrodisiac, but when there is nothing left for the imagination to work with the human body can sometimes seem purely anatomical and not in the least bit sexual.  This applies to the older woman too, some of whom still look quite attractive and would be more interesting had they not flapped their baps around.
  
Having said all that, there was one woman by the pool yesterday who's breasts were magnificent in every way. I hope she doesn't keep them covered up today as I need to study them for a little while longer.
