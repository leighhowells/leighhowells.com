Today my kids decided that they wanted to paint their faces.  On their own.

So they both painted the face of the other.Â   I think they had a pirate theme developing, but the noise and hilarity not to mention the mess brought things to an end sooner rather than later.

It kept them busy and happy for at least an hour though, which is worth it's weight in dirty hand prints.
