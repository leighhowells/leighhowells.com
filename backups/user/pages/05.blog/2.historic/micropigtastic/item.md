Had a fun time today at Little Pig Farm with Jane Croft, one of the few suppliers/breeders of micopigs in the UK.Â  She has a thriving and growing business bringing these small pigs from sty into the heart of the home.

She has 2 pigs living in the house, a fabulous though slightly subsiding converted pumping station in the wilds of the fens.  They sleep in the kitchen in a dog basket, have their own pig flap and have the run of the house as any other domestic animal would have.
