All my life I've heard, even repeated to others that you should 'never give up', 'keep on trying', quiting is for losers, blah blah.  But really, sometimes maybe you should just give up and do something else. Give something a try, if it doesn't work out move on and do something else.  Of course I have a case to demonstrate this or this post would be pointless.

A few weeks ago I got very excited and carried away about building a site to pull together the plethora of web and design conferences, workshops, seminars that seem to be randomly appearing in tweets - almost on a daily basis. I did the inevitable Google research that initiates these small acorns. 

I couldn't find any general sites, other than the conference sites' own advertising sites, and no real hub for pulling them all together, searching, or displaying in calendar format etc. 

I talked about it with others, none of which knew of any useful sites fitting the bill.

> I looked long and hard for sites collating design conferences, but nothing really jumped out at me.  I asked around, again nothing.

I wanted to build a community of web/design people to comment on all of these events, to review the speakers, venue, social aspects and perhaps in some way make them accountable for quality. To help define the conference, who it's intended for and the level of expertise.

I started sensibly, a quick technology review lead me to the conclusion that it would be wise to start collating information into a Wordpress site than investing too much time on a full custom-database solution. I customised a theme, and started adding information, adding plugins to help with categorisation, calendar and event details and ratings.

I got quite excited by how it looked and how it worked.  It was jazzy, simple and effective.  I knew it was quick and dirty, and could never do all I wished of it being built in this way.  But if it became popular, I would rebuild and relaunch.  I already had a couple of people who said they would add content and maintain things.

Then it happened.  I was sent a couple of links from others who had found sites that basically did the same thing, but did it much better.  Not just better, but with a lot more resourcing, time, effort and skill than I could possibly hope for.   But the clear winner of these sites:

[Lanyrd.com](http://lanyrd.com/).  It's an excellent site and service - the Twitter integration is perfect, and annoyingly never even crossed my mind.  So obvious really, my first use of Twitter started at SXSW after all.

I am really very thankful that Lanyrd exists. It was so necessary.  So I packed up my things, cleared my drawers, got my coat and gave up gracefully and happy.  Time for something new.
