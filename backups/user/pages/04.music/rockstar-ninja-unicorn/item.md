A little ‘punk-pop’ song (my first and probably last) to mark the occasion of my daughter’s 12th Birthday. Written from her point of view – she’s supposed to be singing it, but well… she was too scared. I’m no singer, but processing has advanced enough to make it bearable.

It’s a little song about the things she says and does, a blossoming identity, the current love of various bands and the all too familiar horror as her parents ‘invade’ the forbidden sanctuary of her bedroom.

With backing vocal help from her little brother.  The lyrics are below.

ROCKSTAR NINJA UNICORN  

Dont want to wear my coat today,  
this hoodie’s cool,  
So cool – it’s minus 4 out here,  
but hey I’m no-ones fool.    

I know so many people,  
who just don’t know their own mind,  
They copy what I do and wear,  
and everything I find,  
I just want to be a rockstar ninja unicorn.  

Uh oh – They’re coming in now,  
Oh no – Asking to show,  
Uh oh – Things I want to hide,  
Oh No – Too many questions,  
Oh No – my indiscretions,  
Oh God- It’s like a freakin’ Zoo.  
GET OUT OF MY ROOM  

LMAOL What the hell,  
I’m gonna face palm through the day,  
My world is full of random stuff,  
and I live the Gerard way.  

My Charlotte’s pretty Good now,  
and I’m bowling for my soup,  
Romance is clearly Chemical,  
get your hands off my favourite groups.  

Uh oh – They’re coming in now,  
Oh no – Asking to show,  
Uh oh – Things I want to hide.  
Oh No – Too many questions,  
Oh No – my indiscretions,  
Oh God- It’s like a freakin’ Zoo.  
GET OUT OF MY ROOM  

I don’t know where I’m heading,  
and I’m quite used to getting,  
more of what I want than what I really need.  

I’ve got this little brother,  
he plays Minecraft. He’s a geek.  
Spends his days in virtual landscapes,  
digging blocks and annoying sheep.  

I haven’t got a halo and my duty’s hardly called,  
My ops are pretty black though,  
from my eye-line to my walls.  

Uh oh – They’re coming in now,  
Oh no – Asking to show,  
Uh oh – Things I want to hide.  
Oh No – Too many questions,  
Oh No – of indiscretions,  
Oh God- It’s like a freakin’ Zoo.  
GET OUT OF MY ROOM  
  
[Repeat]
