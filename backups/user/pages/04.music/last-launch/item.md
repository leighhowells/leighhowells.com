Got back into writing music last night after recently setting up my ‘studio’ on a shiny new machine. I seem to have produced some kind of short orchestral space journey that sounds quite American – guess it’s that horn sound.

Anyway, quite fitting that the last shuttle returns to Earth today; so it gets named accordingly. Knocked up a quick little video as some visual accompaniment too.
