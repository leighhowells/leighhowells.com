Here I tried to create something a little Thomas Newman-esqe on the piano, with a bit more of a break-beat feel.   So it's basically a piano progression with a smattering of sitar, tabla, vocal samples, accompanied all the way by a heavy bass line and delayed xylophone rhythms.

Things I'm pleased with;  squeezing in a classic Korg Wavestation rhythm, some pitch work on some gypsy choir samples to retune them; the flute sound and my attempts to make tabla effects. Quite pleased with the piano theme, although this basic mix may be a little harsh sounding.  If this is one I return to, I'll tidy things up at a later date.  I'm not sure where this fits genre-wise, nor do I care.
