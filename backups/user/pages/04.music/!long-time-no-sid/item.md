I've been meaning to install a [SID chip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_SID) (Sound Interface Device) virtual instrument for a while now and get all nostalgic about my 8-bit electronic music roots. Here's the result.![](http://www.leighhowells.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif)<!-- more -->

The Commodore 64 was blessed with a rather spectacular sound chip (also the [CBM-II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_CBM-II), [Commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), [Commodore 128](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128) and [Commodore MAX Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_MAX_Machine) [home computers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_computer)) called the 6581/8580 SID which programmers of the time made innovative and wonderful creative use of despite its limitations. A cult grew up around the sound chip and the musicians that provided the soundtracks for the top games. You still here these sounds occasionally - albeit in slightly dubious places, an off-shoot of the '[demo scene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene)' which peaked in the 80's and early 90's.

So, here's a little SID based tune from an evening session last night. Not sure how it ended up being quite so jolly, but I think I may have been quite excited to hear the old sounds again and got carried away with it all. I didn't manage to stay completely authentic to SID as I initially intended to; I couldn't help but add a smattering of delay, reverb, string samples and a bit of strengthening percussion just to make it a tiny bit more palatable to 21st century ears.
