This track is a bit bonkers.  At some point or another in the early hours of Wednesday morning it got lost somewhere between Hans Zimmer and Pendulum and is very much in two distinct sections, with a bit of a tempo change half way through.

Suffering wisdom tooth pain all week somehow lead to crazy big soundtrack percussion, a big cheesy guitar rif, and a bit of ear splitting resonant synth.  It did nothing for my wisdom tooth, gave me a headache and nearly made my ears bleed.  Music therapy this was not.

Play it loud.  Damage your speakers and your hearing today.
