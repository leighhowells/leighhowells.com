The Solitude Ark

A house in South Wales is cut from the world.  Literally removed in a perfect disk.  Vanished overnight. (based on salt marsh farm)

Owen only played with Sian and Tommy the previous day, but now not only had his friend gone, so had his sister and the entire house.  

Crop circles were just the beginning.  Now homes around the globe had literally been cropped from existence one a month.  Perfect circles cut deep in the earth with everything removed. 

Sian woke up.  It was still dark.  It was 8am.  It should be light by now, surely.  She went to the light switch.  Nothing.   She found her little brother.  He was asleep.  Went outside.  The garden was quiet, apart from a blackbird.  It was singjng loudly in loud panic call. It was
The only bird.  It sang and sang. As Sian walked the path there was a rush of wings and a bang and the blackbird fell from the sky like it had hit a pane of glass.  Silence.  No not quite.  A drone. A deep intense drone somewhere deep beneath.   She noticed something now cut in half at first.  

Mystery told from earth's perspective.  Investigator works out a pattern of the 'Sampling'. 

Wales, france, Spain.  Everywhere on earth with a thousand mile grid. 

Sian and tommy near suffocation.  The darkness is replaced with intense light. Blinding white.  A tube appears from the top of the dome and a liquid pumped in.   Find they can breath it and swim.   The appearance is of a snow done toy.  Is that what they are? Be vague on this not very original leave it as implicit but not spelled out.   Description of all the stuff floating around.  house falling apart .  The disinfection.  

Darkness.   Sleep.  Unconsciousness.  

Awake.  Pure white.  Vast white plain.   The house on a huge white plain.   It was rebuilt.  No sign of tommy.  She walked through intense brightness.   Sees a house.  A yurt with camels perhaps.   Taken from Mongolia.   Noone here.    No sand, just pure white.  

Comes to another glass wall it runs endlessly. Darkness on the other side.  Shadows.  Faces.  Couldn't describe them as faces.   Nightmarish vision of dark eyes watching.   Runs back to house.  Finds tommy hiding.  Discussion etc.   

Display case phase.  They are in a display.   This is left vague.

Uncle Neville 

Their house was now perfect.  Everything better than it had ever been. Painted. Clean. 


The scientist realises that each home taken exactly along south west perfect line  from centre point of centre of large cities.  Not the geographic centre but the illumination centre as seen from night map.  Where there is no light.  Along south west parallel.  The Discs have been cropped.

Instead of having disk, it's a sphere or bubble

The bubble is a bit reflective on the inside.  Can't get through.  Semi opaque. Light gets through. 

Children swim in the rene as they are warm.  Notice elbow going though bubble.  Minnie realised you can penetrate bubble when wet.   Pushes through gel-like.  

They realise the dilemma if Minnie goes through how does she know she can get back.  She takes a flask of water to wet herself.    

They don't do it immediately but get prepared first.  Decide to go together so they don't get trapped apart.

Bubbles look like they are floating in bright windy atmosphere.     But realise they are connected via a transparent lattice of paths they can walk across.  Bright white, windy, white clouds, gassy.   See bubble in distance and decide to head to it.   Realise the bubble must be what they are also in.  

First bubble is savanna and yurt

Second bubble is a strange forest, with stick thing

Third is a desert with conical pyramid there. No sign of life.  Pincer grabs tommys foot pulling him into the sand.  


Earth side there is a crater 2/3 filled with water.   Carlos sends in divers, then has it drained.   Realises it is a hemispherical crater the crater is 25 metres deep, forwards.  




Reports of large sand bowl being created in mongolia.  Another in northern Norway or Guatemala.

Crop spheres.  Literally cropped.
