<small>&#x2015; A poem for my Dad, Leigh Howells 2009.</small>

===






You are around us and through us,
Wrapped within mortar and written in stone.
You are signed in curve and shape,
Gracing walls and growing skyward.

You flow through our veins and fill each heart,
Living through laughter in all that knew.
An infinite carving of love and biology,
Never forgotten, and never we part.
