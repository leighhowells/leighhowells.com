Digging around and mucking out some old Headscape folders, I found a remarkable photo of Harry Potter in a mini bus.  Took me a moment to notice I was driving the thing and this was in fact Mr Boag himself off for a game of Quidditch.   I believe this was before the films were even made, and hmmm, looking closely I'm pretty sure that's a scar on his forehead.
