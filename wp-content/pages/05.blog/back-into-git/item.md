I've been trying to use GIT for years now, but have buried my head in the sand as it has always seemed a bit tricky.  I've also tried a lot of different GIT clients and a few different ways to get myself into it but all have fallen flat.

===

As I rarely work on shared code, GIT is easy to ignore altogether.  But as a basic work-flow procedure, providing backups and a way to get back to previous versions it started to be silly to not use it.

There are a few services for hosting GIT repositories.  But I am currently having much better success than normal using [Bitbucket](www.bitbucket.com) and [SourceTree](www.sourcetree.com).  Success means I am still using both a few weeks after starting. Something that never, ever happens.  Both come from [Atlassian](www.atlassian.com), and tie in well with each other.

SourceTree isn't the simplest GIT client I've used, and the myriad of options are a bit confusing.  But it all seems to work well as long I don't start pressing and clicking on options I don't understand.

Now I just have to remember it exists, and use it.
