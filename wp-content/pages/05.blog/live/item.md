Ok, so I put my nice little flat site live, mainly to make it easier to fix a few mobile width issues.   All looking fine, apart from the odd default browser on my generic Android Jelly Bean tablet which seems to be missing a navigation bar.  Odd, can't think why that would happen.   I should probably fix IE7/8/9/10 too... as the whole navigation appears to be completely screwed.  Ho hum.
