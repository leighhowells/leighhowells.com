### Quick Review 

Clever idea for the album title, using a hash tag. Was he the first to do that?  I have forgotten most of what this sounded like, but I really liked 3 tracks - The first track 'Good Morning' was rather pleasant.  Scream and Shout was rather catchy (which I believe features Britney Spears. God did I just admit to liking something by her?).  I also enjoyed Geekin' too because it made me laugh,  mainly because I actually listened to the lyrics.  Oh, and I'm a geek of course.   

The rest was forgettable, seemed to use a lot of autotune (is that STILL cool?).  I probably won't listen to it all ever again, intentionally at least.
