Well, it's not very often that I like a photo of me.  Here's one Ed Merritt took on our recent trip to a Washington law firm.  We were doing some test attorney photography exploring casual natural light.

Even though this image is completely wrong for the intended purpose (arms unfolded, looking at the camera and possibly smiling would be far more appropriate and envoking trust) I quite liked it regardless.
