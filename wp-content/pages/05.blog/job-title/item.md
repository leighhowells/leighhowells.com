I've been pondering today what my job title should be.  I'm currently a designer, who does UX work, but also I'm doing some project management.   I'm creative, have direct technical knowledge, produce content, build content sites.  It's hard to know what to call myself that anyone would really understand.

I'm leaning towards an all encompassing title like 'Online Producer' or 'Web Producer'... after all - through my work, websites are produced so I guess it makes perfect sense.  

Web Director would in some ways make more sense, but that's a tricky title when I'm not a Director of the company - just a Director of projects.
