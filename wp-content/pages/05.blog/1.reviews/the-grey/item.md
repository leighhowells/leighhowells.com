I've noticed this film hanging around on Netflix for a while, but couldn't stomach the grim prospect of watching an air crash and survival film.  Even though the air crash part is rather memorable in it's horror, this film left me much more worried by wolves than air travel.

Liam Neeson is the hero leading a motley crew of survivors in an attempt to survive the frozen wastelands of Alaska.  Ultimately it's really a film about the alpha male, in and between both man and beast.  There's quite a lot of standing around 'establishing characters' however that could really have been cut a little.  But the sub-plot, scenary and conclusion were enough to make it a memorable and enjoyable couple of hours.  [7/10]
