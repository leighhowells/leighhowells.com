An intriguing film by Christopher Nolan. Essentially Memento is a gritty film noir-esque thriller with a unique twist.

The main character suffers from short term memory loss but nonetheless is tracking down the killer of his murdered wife (and reason for his memory loss).  The film therefore plays out like a puzzle, in reverse, as we piece together the ending (which is the beginning) and learn how it all started (the ending).  

I admit to being a little lost at the end (the beginning), I think I got it - but I'm not 100% sure.  So now I'm going to have to watch it again and make sure I'm paying full attention.  Having Googled a little bit, I see I'm not alone and there are many theories and explanations (not pretentious hidden meaning type theories - it's not a pretentious film by any means).  Great film, brilliantly edited to keep the story-line flowing in reverse, and a brilliant performance from Guy Pearce (who I really should have stopped thinking of as 'Mike from Neighbours' by now).

A Netflix gem, well worth a watch if you haven't seen it.  Just make sure you are watching it properly and not fiddling about with your 'second screen' as you do.
