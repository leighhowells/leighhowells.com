*I've tried to never re-watch this film since its release in 1993.   It had such a devastating effect on me at the cinema that I really didn't want to put myself through it again nor do it an injustice by watching on TV.*

However, in preparation for my daughter's visit to Auschwitz, I watched it again on a decentish projector and discovered it was no less hard hitting twenty years later.   Ralph Fiennes was no less chilling, the score no less emotive and the cinematography no less gritty.   I did find Liam Neeson's final scene a little over-the-top a second time around but it was interesting to generally reconsider Schindler's business and philanthropic motivations as portrayed by Spielberg.
