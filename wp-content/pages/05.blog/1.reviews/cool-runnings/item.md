It's only taken me 21 years to get round to finally seeing this unlikely Olympic story, but I've heard it mentioned so many times along the way.

Having watched the story of the real 1988 team though, I'm not sure why they needed to invent so much for the plot of this comedy.  There were some amusing moments, mostly thanks to strong and varied character performances by the four team members. However, it was probably much more amusing in the 90s than now, especially after watching the 2 man Jamaican Bob team at the Sochi winter Olympics finish last, though not disgrace themselves. [6/10]
