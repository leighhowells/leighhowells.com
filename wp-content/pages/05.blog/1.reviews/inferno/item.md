### Quick Review 

There's a lot of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/16/dan-brown-inferno-plot-to-influence">snobbery and debate about Dan Brown</a>. People love to hate him.  I'm not sure whether it's simply because of his success and popularity or his 'creative' restructuring of reality (it's called fiction though, right?) but I have to say I've really enjoyed all of his novels.

Inferno was no exception, thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.  Accessible, suitably tense, lots of interesting historical, architectural, artistic and literary references, together with puzzles and the obligatory riddles across some of my favourite sites in Europe.  I knew what I was going to be served, and I wasn't disappointed.

Some of the over-explanation of the plot twists and turns seemed a little laboured to me, as did some of the roles of the organisations involved but neither really detracted from the ride.

It may not be literary genius to some, but it's everything I ask for in a light and enjoyable work of fiction. In addition, I didn't see a couple of the plot twists coming, which is always a very good thing as less and less surprises me.  Along the way I learnt a couple of things I never knew about Florence and Dante, and really enjoyed the location of the finale as I recall thinking it would make a great film location during a visit.

In the end I was really pleased that the final word was as it should have been and glad the opportunity wasn't missed (you'll have to read it to understand that reference).
