### Quick Review* i

Sniper rifles, conspiracy, counter-conspiracy, big black cars, entrapment and intrigue.  A bloke that looked like Guy Pearce, but wasn't.  Lots of explosions, some of them ludicrous.  Home made napalm and general mass murder with amusing allusions to justice.  

I got a bit of a feel for the possible 'complexity' of being a long-range marksman, but think I got bored and lost the plot half way through.  

I may have fallen asleep, it's hard to tell sometimes.
