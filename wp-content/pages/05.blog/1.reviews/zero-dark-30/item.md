A chronicle of the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the September 2001 attacks, and his death at the hands of the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 in May 2011.

I really didn't want to watch this after seeing Seal Team Six, but gave it a shot because I enjoyed The Hurt Locker's tension so much.   Kathryn Bigelow really knew how to build tension and 'put you there' in the Hurt Locker, and some of the scenes were almost unbearable.    

Here she really puts us behind the scenes in the investigation to witness the painstaking task of piecing together 'informants' interviews and intelligence.  The enormity of the task, coupled with the politics, imminent dangers and limited resources was really enlightening, and the final scenes expertly immersive.    Of course, who knows how accurate any of the film is, and just how much can even be revealed.  But it's an entertaining and gripping depiction nonetheless.
