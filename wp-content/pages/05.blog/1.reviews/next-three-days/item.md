A very enjoyable and hidden gem on Netflix.

I love prison break movies, the more seemingly impossible the better.   This was a fairly gritty, well-paced production full of surprises coupled with a beautifully choreographed and well-paced plot.  

Russell Crowe really made the naivety of even attempting such a thing tangible, and the director (Paul Haggis) used this to keep up the belief that everything could only ever end badly.   A thoroughly action-packed second half full of tension and twisty turns.  

Don't under-estimate school teachers. Another really good film I'd never heard of.
