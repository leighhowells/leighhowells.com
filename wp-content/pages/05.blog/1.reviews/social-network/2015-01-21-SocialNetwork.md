After watching Noah, The Social Network was a completely different prospect.  I've been trying to force myself to watch this since it came out on DVD, but the concept seemed so dry that I couldn't force myself.  There's been a lot of this lately - watching films that I prejudged and never got round to watch.

How wrong I was.  A simple 'based on true events' plot, no special effects, no all star cast, no twists.  Just a well made piece of story telling with superb smart script, pace, acting and editing.  It had no right to keep me gripped for bang on two hours, but it managed to keep me completely hooked throughout.  David Fincher really knows how to craft an inspiring film.

How true to real events this portrayal is, however, I have no idea.  But this will probably be the story that history records, so I hope it's close. [8/10]
