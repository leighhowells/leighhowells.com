I like submarine films.  I think I watched a lot of black and white war films on BBC2 when I was little. I especially loved the inevitable set piece where the destroyer was closing in and depth charges dropped.

Unfortunately there were no depth charges in The Black Sea, but many other Submariner flick clich√© boxes were adequately ticked.  My favourite, which I'm pretty sure is an absolute necessity in all submarine adventures, is where there is an incident resulting in some kind of flooded compartment and at least one crew member needs to be sealed off to drown, in some split-second door sealing drama.

I enjoyed the Black Sea, was pleased that things didn't go the Hollywood way and the end was not totally what I was expecting.  I'm pretty sure there were plot holes a-plenty here, but let them wash over me for the entertainment it was meant to ultimately be.
