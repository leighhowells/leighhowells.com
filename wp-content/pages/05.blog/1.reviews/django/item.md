*An epic tale from chain gang slave to conquering 'hero'.*  

Tarantino simply knows how to entertain, unless of course you don't relish gratuitous (and splatteringly unrealistic) bloodshed.

Almost 3 hours long it fails to get boring at any point (despite a very simple plot) due to the great characterisation.  Eloquent and unpredictably violent characters are Tarantinos speciality and there are plenty here to keep one suitably tense.

The masked riders scene is classic comedy, and the wobbly tooth cart amuses every time I remember it.  Excellent all-round entertainment once more from Mr Tarantino.
