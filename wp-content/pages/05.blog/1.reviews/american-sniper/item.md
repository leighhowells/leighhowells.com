Clint Eastwood directs the tense, highly patriotic true story of Chris Kyle, an American sniper accountable for taking 173 lives. This film follows how he became a 'legend' to his countrymen and a man with a price on his head to the enemy, how he failed to ultimately separate his family life from the battlefield, and how he dealt with time between tours of duty.  I've heard a lot of positive comments about this film and lots of accusations of it's 'Flag waving' patriotism, and can understand both sentiments.

I feel I've seen a lot of this film before withing Hurt Locker, the 'Sniper' series and 'Shooter' as well as many other tense modern war films such as 'Black Hawk Down'.  It had suitably tense trigger trembling moments of decision making and tense situations and Bradley Cooper gave a suitably gruff and level headed performance, but I must admit to being a little bored as the story was obvious apart from the final moments.  One saving grace for me, the final real life footage  (I assume) was quite moving, you know, because it was a real outpouring. [7/10]
