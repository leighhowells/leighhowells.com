*2 Minute Review*   
I was really excited when I realised there was a new Depeche Mode album, and I knew nothing about it.   

Unfortunately, it features uninspiring sounds - with  little evidence of creative sound design, predictable Depeche Mode type chord progressions, droning vocal performances and little in the way of melody. I'm not sure they'd get much, if any air play from any of this.   

Did I enjoy it? A bit.  It's not terrible, but I doubt I will listen to it again.
