<p class="intro">Lung disease is a blight on modern society and its prevalence shames us all.</p>

One in five people live with lung disease and countless more are affected caring for loved ones. This costs the UK more than £11 billion a year, including the impact on the NHS and the wider economy through work days lost.

Respiratory conditions are responsible for a major part of the gap in life expectancy between the poorest and wealthiest in
the UK. You are twice as likely to develop lung cancer or COPD if you are in the most deprived 10% of the population, compared to the richest.

Despite this burden there is no national plan in place for lung health, as there is for cancer, mental health or stroke. It has never been considered a priority. Even worse, people with lung disease face the additional disadvantage of prejudice and stigma, being blamed for their own condition because of perceived lifestyle choices. Public awareness of what lung disease is and how to prevent it is poor.

This is why there has been no improvement in outcomes for people with lung disease for more than 15 years. While other countries have made significant progress, the UK has been left behind, and so have people with lung disease and their families. Our indifference means that mums and dads, sons and daughters, are dying too soon or living lives severely limited.

Across England access to services, treatment and support is fragmented. Diagnoses are missed or delayed, preventing the opportunity for effective clinical interventions to be put in place.
Treatment and care of lung disease in England has changed little this century.

This is a profound injustice which cannot be allowed to continue. The time to act is now as new threats to lung health emerge, such as poor air quality and work-related lung disease. Although smoking is in sharp decline, numbers of new cases of lung disease continue to rise. We cannot stand by and watch another generation suffer. This is why the Taskforce for Lung Health has been convened, bringing together leading experts and patient representatives in a unique collaboration. Together we have developed a five-year plan to improve the nation’s lung health.

This is a call for action to decision makers to take steps now, without delay, to implement the Taskforce’s recommendations.


It is the right thing to do. And it is the fair thing to do. Because it will create a society where everyone can live with healthy lungs for as long as possible and have a stronger chance of living well when lung disease
is diagnosed.
