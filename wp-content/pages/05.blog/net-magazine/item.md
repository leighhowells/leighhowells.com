I was thrilled to have a feature article printed in the February 2011 (#211) edition of .Net magazine.  I've been in magazines a few times in my life from the age and it's always been really quite exciting.  The first time I was in print was quite amusing to think back to.  I had a couple of games published in Sinclair User - a magazine for avid Sinclair Spectrum and ZX80/81 users.

It's funny to consider that they used to print page after page of A4 code listings which enthusiasts would eagerly type in and run. More often than not it was a disappointment, either because the game wouldn't run due to some typing mistake, or else the game was just crap.  Mine was very crap.

What's even more curious is the excitement I felt at having something 'in print'.  It's a good feeling, more exciting than having an article 'published' online somehow.
