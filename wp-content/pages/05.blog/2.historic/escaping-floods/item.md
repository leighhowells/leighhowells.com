At last we have sunshine.  Lots of sunshine.  Whilst areas of Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire are underwater back in England, here in Lanzarote water is still a precious resource.

Playa Blanca at the southern end of the island is slightly more sheltered from the winds that are one of Lanzarote's hallmarks. It's still breezy however, which although very refreshing masks the fact that the sun is about to remove several layers of epidermis. After a day at the pool yesterday with factor 15 sunscreen, my back and face are feeling rather sensitive today and I look like a lobster eating a beetroot.

I have done rather well with our accommodation again.  It may not be quite the splendour of Tunisia, nor the large living area of our French Gite or Lake Garda/Venetian apartments, but it is adequately equipped and ideally located next to the pool and shop.

The pool is perfect. Not too busy, just big enough to swim well, but not so large we have to keep retrieving children.  As with Tunisia though its minimum depth is over 1.3m so both kids could readily drown if not supervised constantly.

All in all this is a really nice hotel/apartment complex. It is self-contained, well equipped, very clean, nicely landscaped and well designed.  There are 2 pools and 2 kids splash pools, a restaurant, snack cafe, shop, sauna, squash court, kids club and bar.

In fact, today is our third day and we haven't felt the urge to leave yet to explore the resort centre.  Today we will probably wander down to the beach and have a look at the town, if we can drag ourselves away from the pool and sangria.
