Ok, this wasn't taken in 1860, but it shows a domestic Christmas scene at some point in the middle of the 20th Century.

Top left is my Mum, Pamela next to her is her little brother, my uncle, Brian.  In the front row on the left is my grandmother (who died when I was little) with my Grandad; George Williams.  On the right is My great grandmother.

This is just another one of many photographs my Mother has tried to destroy be keeping under or behind the fridge for the last 30 years.   Hopefully I'm going to be better at passing on photographic memories to my descendants.

Except of course most of mine can be instantaneously wiped out by accidental realignment of magnetic particle.Â  Suddenly the back of the fridge seems like a safer bet.
