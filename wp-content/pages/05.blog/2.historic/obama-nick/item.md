Rather amused and possibly a teeny bit proud to see my old school mate Nick Ray with President Obama (apparently it IS a genuine photo, though it looks a bit suspicious to me).  We always accused Nick of 'schmoosing' and being a 'social climber' and now it looks like he's schmoosed his way right to the top.

The CIA/FBI should know, however, that in 1988 this guy deliberately drove us (in a lime green Vauxhall Chevette) the wrong way round the Little Chef roundabout outside Peterborough just to undertake Mark Harrod (in an orange Vauxhall Chevette).   Nick, that is, not Barack.
