I heard an older gentleman talking about his dislike for nostalgia this morning. I believe it was on the Frontrow Podcast from the BBC, but the source is pretty irrelevant.

  It caught my attention probably as it chimed with my own dislike of nostalgia.  I loved his philosophy on the matter, saying "The point of getting up in the morning is to create the future".. i.e. not to keep looking back or wistfully thinking back to 'the good old days'.

I should really try and write each day.  I've done it, starting again on the matter, time and time again - but I always seem to abandon it.  People are always talking about writing as the best way to organise their thoughts and compound their ideas and what they are learning.  I simply don't do it enough.

Maybe if I just enter text files into this thoughts section of my blog, I might actually keep at it.  I've tried number apps, such as 'Day One' and I even tried writing with a pen, which was hard work.  Day One hassled me far too much, so that eventually I just ignored it, and writing with a pen leaves thoughts far too accessible for others to read - it is also knackering which doesn't entice a return to the endeavour.

My day is odd today.  I still have little work on with Headscape being the quietest I've ever known it in 16 years.  I've got stuff to work on, but no deadlines, no meetings, no nothing.   It sounds ideal, but It's been going on too long now and my brain is getting bored.  Now I know I should be 'creating the future' it's made me a little more committed to changing my life for the better.
