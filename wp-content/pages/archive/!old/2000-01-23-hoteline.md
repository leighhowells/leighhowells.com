A 'Flash Intro'.  They used to be a thing.  Annoying intro sequences before you got to the home page of a website - the basic aim of which was to show off a bit about what the site did - or rather just show off what the Flash animator had found out what to do in a 'wooooooo' sort of way.  This was one of the first I did, just after learning about Flash's morph tweening abilities.
