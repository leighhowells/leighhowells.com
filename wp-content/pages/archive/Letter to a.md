Letter to a random stranger

Dear Mr Robinson.  

I hope you don't mind me saying this, but I think about you almost every day as I walk walk past.  I know that probably sounds a bit odd, but I just can't help it .  If I'm honest, it's mostly your name I like;  Noble Robinson.  People just don't have names like that any more (unless they're wealthy, American and a bit pretentious).  I guess it was more of a regular sort of name back in the 19th century, along with Endeavour and such-like (ok, so I can't think of any more examples).  Good solid names to squeeze a life into.  I wonder how noble you actually were though. You could have been a right old bastard, rebelling your whole fairly short existence against the whole suggested nobility thing.   But I like to think you really were very a noble guy as you have quite a prime position in the church cemetery. 

It's annoying that I know nothing more about you than your name and the fact you died in 1811, at 50.  Your grave stone has tolerated the elements for over 200 years and it's somewhat illegible now.   I even tried fiddling with a photograph in Photoshop to see if I could enhance the engraving (heck, you probably don't even know what photography is let alone Photoshop), but I failed to read anything further.   I'm sure there is a book somewhere in the church to find out more, maybe one day I'll investigate.

Yes, you died pretty young by today's standards, and I'm now quite intrigued about what happened. Maybe fifty was a good age to die in 1811 in Cambridgeshire,  but  I can't be sure.  I've Googled your name, and found nothing, you probably wouldn't be able to begin to comprehend what Google is.

Some days I think that if I ever write a book, I will name the main character after you.  

Someone quite clever wrote once that 'we are never truly dead until we are forgotten'.  But you aren't forgotten.  Your name is etched in stone for all to see.

One day soon, when no-one is looking, I'll put flowers on your grave.   A little thank you for sharing my walk through the church yard each morning.
