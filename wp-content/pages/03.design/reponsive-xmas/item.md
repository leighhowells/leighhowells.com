As part of an experiment with Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and as a way of wishing our clients a Happy Christmas (whilst hopefully offering a little education about Responsive Design), I put together an animated Responsive Christmas Card.

Resizing the browser gave information about different widths on different devices, and a link to a video I put together explaining Responsive Web Design further.
