Whilst eating dinner on Friday night, my daughter declared that she is now a vegetarian.   She has made noises about this on previous occasions, but the lure of chicken nuggets has always quietened the notion.  However, this time she appears to be more serious.

I half expected this, but not until she became a teenager.  Kids are certainly maturing more quickly nowadays.  But, it's just as well that I don't mind vegetarian food.  It's just going to be a complete pain in the arse.

However, I'm not entirely convinced she will be able to resist the next batch of sausage rolls that get cooked.
